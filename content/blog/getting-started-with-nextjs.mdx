# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals and get you up and running with your first Next.js project.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a structured way to build web applications with features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **File-based Routing**: Automatic routing based on your file structure
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints right in your Next.js app

## Installation

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward. You can create a new project using:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project has the following structure:

- `pages/` - Your application routes
- `public/` - Static files like images
- `styles/` - CSS files
- `components/` - Reusable React components

## Creating Your First Page

Pages in Next.js are React components. Create a new file in the `pages` directory:

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my Next.js website!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This automatically creates a route at `/about`.

## Conclusion

Next.js simplifies React development with its powerful features and conventions. This is just the beginning - there's so much more to explore including data fetching, dynamic routes, and deployment options.

Happy coding!
